<h1>Assignment: Playground</h1><br>

<b>Welcome to another Core assignment!</b> Some students like to explore the assignments before they're finished reading through the lessons, and that's okay! It can be good for your brain to have a preview of what your future challenges might be. However, before you begin this assignment, it's important that you've first:<br>

<li>Completed the preceding lesson modules</li><br>

<li>Taken the knowledge checks to confirm your understanding</li><br>

<li>Viewed lecture material related to the assignment topics</li><br>

<li>Completed and submitted your practice assignments</li><br>

<h3>Internal Styling</h3><br>

<i>Just for this assignment</i>, use an internal stylesheet or inline CSS (<b>review here</b>).<br>

<h3>Level 1</h3><br>

When a user visits <b>http://localhost:5000/play</b>, have it render three beautiful looking blue boxes. Please use a template to render this.<br>

<h3>Level 2</h3><br>

When a user visits <b>http://localhost:5000/play/(x)<b>, have it display the beautiful looking blue boxes x times. For example, localhost:5000/play/7 should display these blue boxes 7 times. Calling localhost:5000/play/35 would display these blue boxes 35 times. Please remember that x originally is a string, and if you want to use it as an integer, you must first convert it to integer using int(). For example int("7") returns 7.<br>

<h3>Level 3</h3><br>

When a user visits <b>http://localhost:5000/play/(x)/(color)</b>, have it display beautiful looking boxes x times, but this time where the boxes appear in (color). For example, localhost:5000/play/5/green would display 5 beautiful green boxes. Calling localhost:5000/play/35/red would display 35 beautiful red boxes.<br>
